<h2><a id="1_Predict_next_word_in_sentence_6"></a>1. Predict next word in sentence</h2>
<p>This is based a Coursera Data Science Capstone project which I have partially finished. SwiftKey provides a data set of scraped blogs and news sites. I’ve implemented an approach based on short Markov chains. I need to test the accuracy of the algorithm and write up the findings as a report. The Coursera Capstone also requires developing a data product and a Shiny app.</p>
<h2><a id="2_Classify_images_from_security_cameras_9"></a>2. Classify images from security cameras</h2>
<p>This is a problem I’m very interested in. I recently installed security cameras, and I’ve turned on motion alerts. Shadows, trees swaying in the wind, etc., generate many false signals. The system sends a snapshot to my email each time an alert is generated.</p>
<p>It would be nice if there was a filter between me and the system which would look at the images and determine if there are people in them.</p>
<p>It seems possible to do without any advanced AI or machine learning. and rather fall back on the tendency of images from cameras at fixed positions to retain certain features. Color histograms, for example, are used to find image similarity in CBIR (Content-Based Image Retrieval). One challenge would be correcting for lighting. This seems more like a computer vision problem than a data science problem, but I wonder if it wouldn’t be possible to approach this problem as image classification?</p>
<h2><a id="3_Predict_Comic_Book_Sales_17"></a>3. Predict Comic Book Sales</h2>
<p>I know someone who maintains a data set of comic book sales over multiple decades. It would be neat to be able to predict sales of future titles based on historical data.</p>
<h2><a id="4_Baseball_data_21"></a>4. Baseball data</h2>
<p>I started looking at the Lahman Baseball Data Set for Udacity’s Intro to Data Analysis. Some of the questions I’m looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are pitchers worse at batting? This appears to be common knowledge, but I want to quantify the difference with some statistcal rigor.</li>
<li>Did the introduction of the Designated Hitter Rule have any impact on batting performance (batting average, RBI’s, etc.)?</li>
<li>Can we predict performance in batting, pitching or fielding based on other characteristics?</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="5_Customer_Retention_at_Credit_Unions_29"></a>5. Customer Retention at Credit Unions</h2>
<p>For a previous employer that developed software for financial institutions, I started looking at account data to see if there is a way to predict closures in advance, which could help institutions take some preventative action (like offering specials, higher rates, calling the customer for survey, etc.).</p>
<p>The data was very messy, and it was also missing many features that might be predictive. I might also have a hard time getting the data as I am no employed there. :)</p>
<h2><a id="6_Predict_NFL_draft_order_35"></a>6. Predict NFL draft order</h2>
<p>I always thought the draft was fun to follow, back when I followed the NFL. It might be fun to develop a way to predict the draft using data that is publicly available.</p>
